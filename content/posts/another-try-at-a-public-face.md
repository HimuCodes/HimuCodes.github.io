# Another Try at a Public Face

*Published on December 11, 2023*

After years of maintaining a low profile online, I'm making another attempt at building a public presence. This time with a focus on sustainability and authenticity rather than trying to keep up with every platform and trend.

## Why Now?

The landscape of technical communication has evolved significantly. There's more appreciation for:
- Long-form, thoughtful content
- Personal websites over social media
- Quality over quantity in posting
- Authentic voice over polished marketing

## The Approach

This site represents a different philosophy:
- **Calm**: No notifications, no engagement metrics
- **Focused**: Technical content and genuine interests
- **Sustainable**: Easy to maintain, no complex build processes
- **Accessible**: Works without JavaScript, loads fast

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing:
- Deep dives into technical projects
- Experiments with audio programming
- Thoughts on developer tools and workflow
- Notes from conference talks and presentations

The goal isn't to build an audience in the traditional sense, but to create a space for meaningful technical discourse and to document work that might be useful to others.

## Previous Attempts

I've tried this before with mixed success. The difference this time is accepting that consistency matters more than frequency, and that a personal site can be valuable even with irregular updates.

Looking forward to seeing where this goes.
