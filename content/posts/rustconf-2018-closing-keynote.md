# My RustConf 2018 Closing Keynote

*Published on September 14, 2018*

Last month I had the honor of giving the closing keynote at RustConf 2018. The talk focused on the intersection of systems programming and creative expression, particularly in audio and game development contexts.

## The Core Message

Rust's unique position in the systems programming landscape makes it particularly well-suited for creative applications that need both performance and safety. The talk explored three main themes:

### 1. Empowering Creative Expression

Traditional systems languages often require choosing between safety and performance. Rust's ownership model eliminates this false dichotomy, allowing creative developers to focus on their craft rather than debugging memory issues.

### 2. Building Tools for Artists

The best development tools understand the creative process. This means:
- Fast iteration cycles
- Clear error messages
- Predictable performance characteristics
- Minimal cognitive overhead

### 3. Community and Inclusion

The Rust community's emphasis on welcoming newcomers extends naturally to creative fields. By making systems programming more accessible, we open doors for artists, musicians, and game developers who might otherwise be excluded.

## Technical Examples

The talk included several case studies:

- **Audio Processing**: Real-time audio requires precise timing and memory management
- **Game Engine Development**: Complex object graphs with predictable performance
- **Creative Tooling**: Building pipelines that artists actually want to use

## Reception and Follow-up

The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees expressing interest in exploring creative applications of Rust. This led to several follow-up projects and collaborations in the audio programming space.

The talk represents an ongoing conversation about making systems programming more accessible to creative professionals, and I'm excited to see how this space continues to evolve.
