Hey, I’m **Himanshu** — but online you’ll usually bump into me as **himu** (or sometimes **audbhida** when I’m feeling dramatic).

This blog is my little corner of the internet — a place where I spill:

- ⚡ **Engineering rabbit holes** → embedded systems, security, radio hacking, weird compilers.

- 🎛️ **Creative tangents** → music production experiments, TouchDesigner visuals, poems disguised as notes.

- 🪐 **Philosophy of hacking** → what it means to tinker, break, and build with curiosity.

- 🎬 **Film & sound obsessions** → because sometimes _Interstellar_ explains engineering better than a textbook.

I don’t promise polished **“thought leadership.”**  
I promise **curiosity with teeth**, late-night experiments, and half-broken projects you can either laugh at or learn from.

If you hang around long enough, you’ll start to notice a pattern:

> I build weird things.  
> I write about why they matter (or why they broke).  
> And I keep trying to stitch together a life that feels both technical _and_ deeply human.

_This blog is less a portfolio and more a diary with circuits, synths, and a lot of chai._
