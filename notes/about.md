Hi, I’m **Himanshu Tiwari** — but online I’m usually **himu** or sometimes **audbhida**.

I’m a little bit of everything: an engineer, security researcher, music producer, film buff, poet, and occasional philosopher. My life runs on curiosity and chai, and my brain tends to wander across way too many niches (thanks ADHD).

I’m not a fan of boxes, so this “About” is less a clean resume and more a log of all the things I’ve been up to, why they matter to me, and how they all connect.

## What I’m Good At

I’m good at: a few specific things, and a lot of figuring-things-out-on-the-fly. If you throw me a weird problem — whether it’s a radio that won’t talk, a packet that refuses to decode, or a synth that’s making ghost noises — I’ll usually wrestle it into shape (sometimes gracefully, sometimes with a lot of late-night coffee).

I like working across disciplines, stitching hardware and software together, and finding the point where “oh no this is impossible” suddenly becomes “oh wait, this works.”

I’m also (I think?) easy to work with — I don’t take tech too seriously, and I try to keep curiosity bigger than ego.

## Engineering & Security

I like to think of myself as a **renaissance engineer** — someone who builds and breaks systems across disciplines.

- **LoRaPwn** – A LoRaWAN pentesting framework I built during my research fellowship at Université d’Avignon, France. I rewrote the MAC layer from scratch in Rust/C++, swapped AES for ChaCha20-Poly1305, and even integrated CNN-based anomaly detection for smarter audits. It was also my deep dive into radio hacking and bare-metal programming.

- **Project F.L.A.M.E Guardian** – An autonomous fire detection and suppression system that combined AI vision, PLC integration, and robotics. It started as a “what if we…” idea and grew into a full industrial prototype.

- **Slipper Zero** – A Wi-Fi penetration tool built on ESP32 (published in IEEE Xplore at GCWOT 2024). Think deauth attacks, PMKID/handshake captures, DoS testing, and PCAP/HCCAPX integration.


I’ve also built smaller-but-fun things: a secure router (_Privacy-Pi_ with Tor, OpenVPN, WireGuard, Pi-hole), bare-metal drivers for STM32, and weird experiments like writing a Lua interpreter in Rust.

I like challenges where there’s no Stack Overflow answer, where the solution is part reverse-engineering, part poetry.

## Philosophy of Hacking & Engineering

I don’t see hacking as “breaking into things.” To me, hacking is **curiosity with teeth** — tugging on the seams of systems until they reveal how they really work.

My thruline is simple:

> **Constraining systems + generous creativity → expressive, dependable work**

Whether it’s embedded code, a music track, or a poem, I’m drawn to the same tension: making something structured and reliable, but leaving enough chaos in it to surprise and move people.

---

## Music & Creative Coding

I’m also a **melomaniac**. I’ve got over 4,000 liked songs on Spotify, and my playlists jump from EDM to synthwave, from botanica trance to Wagner operas.

I released my **first track on August 19, 2024**, and just dropped my **first EP in 2025**. My music experiments often cross into code:

- **Auralis** – a procedural music generator in Rust I built during Buildspace Season 5. It uses chord theory and cellular automata to make evolving progressions.

- **Granular synthesis** – I love the textures it can create, though I’m still learning how to tame it.


When I can’t make music, I sometimes build tools that make music for me. And recently, I picked up the **guitar** — because why not add more chaos into the mix?

---

## Literature, Film, and Poetry

Outside of wires and waveforms, I’m a huge **film buff**. I’ve been watching movies obsessively since I was a kid — _Interstellar_ still hits me the hardest. I even once made a **glass-painted Avicii plaque** that ended up as the top post on r/EDM.

I also write poetry and dabble in literature. For me, poems are like embedded drivers: compact, minimal, but carrying an entire system of feeling underneath.

---

## Talks, Writing & Sharing Knowledge

I love explaining complex systems in **human language**. Whether it’s presenting a LoRaWAN pentest framework to researchers in France, writing papers on Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, or just making blog posts that turn packet dumps into stories — teaching is one of the best ways I learn.

I’ve given talks, published papers, written technical documentation, and created keynote decks that walk people through my research step by step.

---

## Random Facts / Quirks

- I have ADHD, which makes me a **divergent builder**.

- I collect **microcontrollers and SIM cards** for no practical reason.

- I hoard data like a digital dragon.

- I’m currently learning **TouchDesigner** to combine my music, code, and visuals.

- I’m an **ENFJ**, which means I somehow manage to be both introspective and very people-oriented.

## Where I’m Headed

Right now, I’m in my final year of engineering, splitting time between:

- Building niche tools (like a Rust Lua interpreter, or AI-powered TDR analysis for my major project).

- Releasing more music and teaching myself guitar.

- Exploring how to fuse my interests into one universe — code, sound, visuals, and writing all woven together.


I want to be a **renaissance engineer** — someone who stitches together different disciplines into expressive, dependable systems.

If you’re into that kind of chaos, we should talk.
